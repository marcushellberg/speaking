# Building an AI chatbot that understands your business: Spring Boot, React, and RAG hands-on

Ever wondered how to build a chatbot that's not only intelligent but also understands your specific business context? We'll kick off with an introduction to large language models (LLMs) and the role of context in enhancing their capabilities. We'll delve into the concept of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a technique that lets your chatbot consult custom documents for better answers.

This talk will feature hands-on coding examples where you'll learn to implement your own AI chatbot using RAG with Spring Boot, React, and Hilla. Walk away with a solid understanding of how RAG can transform your chatbot into a more effective and context-aware tool for your business.
