# Practical AI in Java

At this point, we all know it's easy to have an AI write bad jokes in the console with Java. 

In this talk, we'll put AI to real work by exploring practical AI patterns and practices through hands-on code examples: 

- Prompting best practices
- Document analysis and report generation
- Data extraction from images
- Function calling to access and update data
- Business-context aware chat with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

The talk will give you the skills to integrate AI into your production app. While the code examples use Spring Boot, Vaadin, and Spring AI, the patterns can be easily replicated with other libraries.
